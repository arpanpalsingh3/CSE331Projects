Describe any changes you made to your marvel or graph code, other
than making changes to support generics:

* Added a few tests to the Edge test suit to make sure generics work
* Fixed my BFS comparators, so that they now return alphabetically
in my script tests (BIGGEST CHANGE)
* Also fixed all the small warnings I was receiving in older classes



I would like to point out that I am fully aware of not having any Javadocs for
all the override methods inside the CampusMap class. I purposely did not place
any there because all their specifications are already present in the ModelAPI
class. If I need to have them there, I will make sure to do that after I get
the feedback back from this homework.
