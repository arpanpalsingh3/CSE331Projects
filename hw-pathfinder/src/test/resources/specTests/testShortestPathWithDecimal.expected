# Find a path with Dijkstra's algorithm

created graph simpleGraph

added node A to simpleGraph
added node B to simpleGraph
added node C to simpleGraph
added node D to simpleGraph

added edge 10.332 from A to B in simpleGraph
added edge 1.420 from A to C in simpleGraph
added edge 1.123 from C to D in simpleGraph
added edge 6.924 from D to B in simpleGraph

path from A to B:
A to C with weight 1.420
C to D with weight 1.123
D to B with weight 6.924
total cost: 9.467
