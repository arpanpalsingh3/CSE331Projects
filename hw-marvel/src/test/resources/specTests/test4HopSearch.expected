# Simple test of breadth-first search algorithm.
# Verifies that it can find a path with two "hops" (edges) when there are no
# other edges in the graph.
# Note that in this graph, there is an edge from GORILLA-MAN to HAWK but not
# vice versa. In your full parser-generated Marvel graph, relationships are
# bidirectional, meaning an edge from A to B will always be accompanied by an
# edge from B to A.
