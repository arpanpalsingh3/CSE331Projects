Briefly describe any changes made to your Graph ADT from previous assignments,
and why those changes were made below. If you made no changes, state that
explicitly. (See the marvel assignment spec for details.)



* Made edge class have capital first letter, and other minor visual changes
* Separated Edge Test from Graph Test and made it into its own test suit
* Edge is no longer implements comparable, so no compare method anymore
* Got rid of graph name field along with all methods and tests related
  as suggested by TA feedback



SIDE NOTES FOR HW6
* Modified staffSuperheros.tsv slightly by removing Notkin(331)
  so that I could test 2 hop BFSearch



I know I have a lot of comments in my code, but that is just there to help me
understand my code better and not get confused, as some of the buildGraph
method was getting me confused. I wanted to see if this is okay
to have, or should I completely remove them on following assignments and
make them shorter?

Another small design change that I made last minute, was having all my
build graph code inside the buildGraph method. Before that, I had my buildGraph
method use the parseData method, and that parseData method would return a complete graph.
I was wondering if that is a poor design choice, or does it not matter? I felt that
having all the code all inside the parseData was cleaner, but the build graph method didn't
actually do anything other than call parseData, take whatever that returned, and return that
graph. No actual graph building inside the buildGraph.
Just wanted an opinion on which design choice is better, or if there's no difference at all.
