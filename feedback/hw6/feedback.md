#### Overall Feedback
Overall, good job! Your code is looking good, but you may have some functionality issues
with alphabetizing edges in BFS. I would also buff up your test suite. 

#### More Details
- Your code does not return the correct lexicographical least path between G'RATH and
Hawk.
- Nice comments! However, I would add a little bit less that provide more value to your code
to make sure that your code is a bit more readable.
- Your test suite is a bit weak. You should include more edge cases on your FindPath and
LoadGraph operaitons, like cyclical graphs, etc.
