CSE 331 Homework Answers:

Your Name: Arpanpal Singh

List any additional features or functionality you implemented
in your CampusPaths application below. Only things listed here
will be considered for extra credit.

I made it so that my findShortestPath from CampusMap ADT checks to see if the input
given to the function was actually a short name or a long name. If it was a long name,
it would convert it into a short name. That is the only thing I changed from the previous
ADTs. This is simply for the purpose of being able to give long names in the campusPaths
assignment.

Also, I would have made it better, but I ran out of time, sorry :(
